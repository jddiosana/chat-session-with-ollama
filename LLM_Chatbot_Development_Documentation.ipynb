    "- Easy local setup (tutorial: [https://ollama.com/download/linux](https://ollama.com/download/linux))\n",
    "- Docker support (see: [https://ollama.com/blog/ollama-is-now-available-as-an-official-docker-image](https://ollama.com/blog/ollama-is-now-available-as-an-official-docker-image))\n",

    "- Generating the session title\n",
    "- Streaming the chatbot response\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, these were executed sequentially. This led to noticeable delays and a less responsive UI. To solve this, I introduced `asyncio` to run both tasks in parallel, since they are independent of each other. This reduced the overall wait time and significantly improved the user experience. This idea has also led me to update other operations, like delete a session, to be asynchronous as well to further reduce the frontend latency."

    "- **Ollama** for efficient local LLM inference\n",
    "- **LangChain** for chaining model logic and integrating memory\n",
    "- **PostgreSQL** for persistent session memory\n",

Containerization was adopted to improve deployability and reproducibility, even though it initially posed a learning curve."
